Tic-Tac-Toe AI

Overview
This project implements an AI agent for the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe. The AI uses the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning to make the game challenging and nearly unbeatable. This project demonstrates fundamental game theory concepts and search algorithms.

Features
Minimax Algorithm: AI evaluates all possible moves to determine the best move.
Alpha-Beta Pruning: Optimizes the Minimax algorithm to improve performance by eliminating branches in the game tree that do not need to be explored.
Human vs. AI: Play Tic-Tac-Toe against the AI.
