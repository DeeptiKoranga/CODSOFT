# Task 2: Image Captioning AI

This project combines computer vision and natural language processing to build an image captioning AI. It uses a pre-trained image recognition model (ResNet) to extract features from images and generates captions using an RNN model.

## Files

- `image_captioning.py`: Contains the code for feature extraction and caption generation.

## Instructions

1. **Feature Extraction**: Uses ResNet to extract features from images.
2. **Captioning Model**: Implements an RNN to generate captions based on extracted features.

## Requirements

- TensorFlow
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Pillow
